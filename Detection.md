# Section of objection detection

## Models:
We use Yolov5 as the main approach to detect the toys, the codes can be directly downloaded at: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
## Training of models:
We follow the same hyper-parameters as in YoloV5, and train the model on our Youth dataset. Since we only detect toys, the categories are different from original yolo, which can be found at youth.yaml.
## Training weights:
The weights can be downloaded at:
